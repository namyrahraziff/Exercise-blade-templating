<p> Name: IIUM E-Book Sharing Application.</p>
<p> Made for: INFO 3305 (Section 2)- Web Application Development.</p>
<p> History: Founded, developed and produced in December 2020. <br>
This website is created to help students stuck in campus to have some reading materials during CMCO period.<br>
Rather than going to the library with limited operating hours and to prevent meeting people, developers and producers decided to build a website of e-books collection. <br>
We also aspire to expand and increase the reading materials to include extra studying materials in future.</p>
<p> Web Author: Madam Marini and Namirah</p>
<p> Web Developer: Namirah (1816818)</p>
<p> Web Producer: KICT (IIUM)</p>
